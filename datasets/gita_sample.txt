Bhagavad Gita - Chapter 2 (Karma Yoga)

Verse 47:
You have a right to perform your duty, but you are not entitled to the fruits of action. 
Never consider yourself the cause of the results of your activities, and never be attached to not doing your duty.

Verse 48:
Be steadfast in yoga, O Arjuna. Perform your duty and abandon all attachment to success or failure. 
Such evenness of mind is called yoga.

Verse 50:
One who is engaged in devotional service rids himself of both good and bad actions even in this life. 
Therefore, strive for yoga, O Arjuna, which is the art of all work.
